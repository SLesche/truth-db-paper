# Results
All analysis were conducted using `r r_citations$r`. `r r_citations$pkgs`.

In the current version of the manuscript, we included `r nrow(study_overview) %>% apa_num()` studies from `r nrow(publications_overview) %>% apa_num()` publications, spanning `r length(unique(full_data$subject)) %>% apa_num()` participants contributing `r nrow(full_data) %>% apa_num()` trials. A complete list of the included publications can be found in Table **table with refs, studies, trials here**.

```{r}
age_data <- study_overview %>% 
  mutate(participant_age = ifelse(participant_age == 99, NA, participant_age)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(participant_age), !is.na(n_participants))
```

Sample composition ranged from `r min(study_overview$n_participants, na.rm = TRUE)` to `r max(study_overview$n_participants, na.rm = TRUE)` participants. On average, studies included `r mean(study_overview$n_participants, na.rm = TRUE)` participants ($\mu_{age} =$ `r weighted.mean(age_data$participant_age, age_data$n_participants, na.rm = TRUE)`,$\sigma_{age} =$ `r DescTools::SD(age_data$participant_age, weights = age_data$n_participants, na.rm = TRUE)`). An overview of the rating scale usage for truth judgments and the use of a filler task over all included studies can be found in Figure \@ref(fig:study-overview-plot).

```

On average, studies employed `r mean(procedure_data$n_statements)` ($SD =$ `r sd(procedure_data$n_statements)`) statements per 
participant in the judgment session and in `r print_freq_percent(sum(procedure_data$percent_repeated == 50) / nrow(procedure_data))` of procedure settings exactly 50% of statements were repeated. Of `r nrow(procedure_data)` judgment phases, `r print_freq_percent(sum(procedure_data$repetition_time < 180) / nrow(procedure_data))` were conducted on the same day as the exposure phase. The average delay between exposure and judgment phase if both were conducted on the same day was `r procedure_data %>% filter(repetition_time < 180) %>% pull(repetition_time) %>% mean()` minutes. The average delay between exposure and judgment phase, given the judgment phase was conducted at least one day after the exposure phase, was `r round((procedure_data %>% filter(repetition_time > 180) %>% pull(repetition_time) %>% mean())/(60*24), 2)` days. An overview of additional variables pertaining to the procedure of the included studies can be found in Figure \@ref(fig:procedure-overview-plot).

## Multilevel Modelling

To illustrate the benefits of our large collection of trial-level data, we applied bayesian multilevel models predicting truth judgments with repetition as a fixed effect and random intercepts and slopes at the subject, statement, and procedure levels.

We analyzed the dichotomous and Likert-type response formats separately due to differences in their scale characteristics. Dichotomous responses (e.g., true/false) require logistic models, whereas Likert-type responses (e.g., 1–5 ratings) allow for linear models. All responses were maximum-normalized to the range 0-1 with one representing the maximum possible response indicating a "true" judgment. The repetition status was mean-centered to aid model estimation, a new statement was coded -0.5 and a repeated statement 0.5.

We ran all models using 4 chains with 3000 iterations per chain, 1000 of which were discarded as warmup-samples, leading to a total of 8000 posterior samples. There were no divergent transitions, no $\hat{R} > 1.05$, and visual inspection confirmed that the chains mixed well. We used weakly informative priors for the intercept, fixed effect, and standard deviations for all models.

$$Intercept \sim Normal(0.5, 0.5)$$
$$b \sim Normal(0, 1)$$
$$\sigma \sim Gamma(1, 4)$$

### Dichotomous Truth Judgments
The analysis was based on `r nrow(dichotomous_data) %>% apa_num()` trials nested within `r length(unique(dichotomous_data$subject)) %>% apa_num()` subjects, `r length(unique(dichotomous_data$statement_id)) %>% apa_num()` statements, and `r length(unique(dichotomous_data$procedure_id)) %>% apa_num()` procedures.

Table TODO provides a summary of parameter estimates. As expected, the model indicated a significant fixed effect of repetition ($OR =$ `r summary_model_full_dichotomous_bayes$fixed$Estimate[2] %>% exp() %>% apa_num()`, $95\% \ CrI =$ `r paste0("[", summary_model_full_dichotomous_bayes$fixed[2, 3] %>% exp() %>% apa_num(), ", ", summary_model_full_dichotomous_bayes$fixed[2, 4] %>% exp() %>% apa_num(), "]")`). Notably, the standard deviation of the random slope of repetition was highest at the subject level ($\sigma =$ `r summary_model_full_dichotomous_bayes$random$subject$Estimate[2] %>% apa_num()`, $95\% \ CrI =$ `r paste0("[", summary_model_full_dichotomous_bayes$random$subject[2, 3] %>% apa_num(), ", ", summary_model_full_dichotomous_bayes$random$subject[2, 4] %>% apa_num(), "]")`), followed by the procedure level ($\sigma =$ `r summary_model_full_dichotomous_bayes$random$procedure_id$Estimate[2] %>% apa_num()`, $95\% \ CrI =$ `r paste0("[", summary_model_full_dichotomous_bayes$random$procedure_id[2, 3] %>% apa_num(), ", ", summary_model_full_dichotomous_bayes$random$procedure_id[2, 4] %>% apa_num(), "]")`), and the statement level ($\sigma =$ `r summary_model_full_dichotomous_bayes$random$statement_id$Estimate[2] %>% apa_num()`, $95\% \ CrI =$ `r paste0("[", summary_model_full_dichotomous_bayes$random$statement_id[2, 3] %>% apa_num(), ", ", summary_model_full_dichotomous_bayes$random$statement_id[2, 4] %>% apa_num(), "]")`).

### Scale Truth Judgments
The analysis was based on `r nrow(scale_data) %>% apa_num()` trials nested within `r length(unique(scale_data$subject)) %>% apa_num()` subjects, `r length(unique(scale_data$statement_id)) %>% apa_num()` statements, and `r length(unique(scale_data$procedure_id)) %>% apa_num()` procedures.

Table TODO provides a summary of parameter estimates. As expected, the model indicated a significant fixed effect of repetition ($b =$ `r summary_model_full_scale_bayes$fixed$Estimate[2] %>% apa_num()`, $95\% \ CrI =$ `r paste0("[", summary_model_full_scale_bayes$fixed[2, 3] %>% apa_num(), ", ", summary_model_full_scale_bayes$fixed[2, 4] %>% apa_num(), "]")`). Again, the standard deviation of the random slope of repetition was highest at the subject level ($\sigma =$ `r summary_model_full_scale_bayes$random$subject$Estimate[2] %>% apa_num()`, $95\% \ CrI =$ `r paste0("[", summary_model_full_scale_bayes$random$subject[2, 3] %>% apa_num(), ", ", summary_model_full_scale_bayes$random$subject[2, 4] %>% apa_num(), "]")`), followed by the procedure level ($\sigma =$ `r summary_model_full_scale_bayes$random$procedure_id$Estimate[2] %>% apa_num()`, $95\% \ CrI =$ `r paste0("[", summary_model_full_scale_bayes$random$procedure_id[2, 3] %>% apa_num(), ", ", summary_model_full_scale_bayes$random$procedure_id[2, 4] %>% apa_num(), "]")`), and the statement level ($\sigma =$ `r summary_model_full_scale_bayes$random$statement_id$Estimate[2] %>% apa_num()`, $95\% \ CrI =$ `r paste0("[", summary_model_full_scale_bayes$random$statement_id[2, 3] %>% apa_num(), ", ", summary_model_full_scale_bayes$random$statement_id[2, 4] %>% apa_num(), "]")`).

To further explore the influence of temporal delay between the exposure and judgment phases on inter-individual variability in the repetition effect, we included an interaction between subject and temporal delay (same-day vs. different day) in the random effect structure. This effectively introduces two sources of variance in the intercept and repetition effect with separate standard deviations. We can then investigate whether the difference in the standard deviation of the random effect of repetition on the subject-level is different depending on the temporal delay.

Table TODO provides a summary of parameter estimates. The standard deviation of the random slope of repetition at the subject level for a same-day judgment phase was $\sigma_0 =$ `r mean(sd_1) %>% apa_num()` ($95\% \ CrI =$ `r paste0("[", quantile(sd_1, 0.025) %>% apa_num(), ", ", quantile(sd_1, 0.975) %>% apa_num(), "]")`). The standard deviation for the random slope on a later day judgment phase was $\sigma_1 =$ `r mean(sd_0) %>% apa_num()` ($95\% \ CrI =$ `r paste0("[", quantile(sd_0, 0.025) %>% apa_num(), ", ", quantile(sd_0, 0.975) %>% apa_num(), "]")`). The difference in standard deviations in the random effect of repetition at the subject level deviated substantially from zero $\sigma_0 - \sigma_1 =$ `r mean(sd_diff) %>% apa_num()` ($95\% \ CrI =$ `r paste0("[", quantile(sd_diff, 0.025) %>% apa_num(), ", ", quantile(sd_diff, 0.975) %>% apa_num(), "]")`).
