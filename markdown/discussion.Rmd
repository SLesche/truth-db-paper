# Discussion
In this paper, we introduce the Truth-Effect Database (TED), an open source database containing truth judgments from over 10.000 participants in a standardized format. This standardization allows data to be interoperable and reusable, thus ensuring FAIR data in truth effect research.

Data is structured unsing SQL, tables

We have information on publications, studies, participants, trials

Data can be easily extracted using the R package `acdcquery`. This allows for simple definition of filter criteria and extraction.

Data entry can be done unsing WEBSITE, which automatically checks consistencies and flags incorrect variable names / entries

This large scale database allows fine-grained re-analysis of a large number of studies.

To illustrate this, we conducted...

Show results from variance decomposition of truth effect and the impact of repetition timing

discuss selection bias in initial study sample. 

Discuss how results from repetition timing might also be related to this selection bias?

Discuss how we hope others can contribute, this needs to be added to the database description aswell (a text on how we deal with people submitting data).

Discuss the important aspect of longevity! Highlight what could be done in the future with more funding (dedicated server, team review)

Discuss data principiles such as FAIR, as directed by DFG 

Discuss incentives for data submission (maybe add to introduction aswell)

Give a short outline of what could be done with the database (broad, like in the grant proposal:
living meta-analyses, power simulations, etc.)
