# Discussion
Show ease of use, highlight this 

Show results from variance decomposition of truth effect and the impact of repetition timing

discuss selection bias in initial study sample. Discuss how we hope others can contribute, this needs to be added to the database description aswell (a text on how we deal with people submitting data).

Discuss how results from repetition timing might also be related to this selection bias?

Discuss the important aspect of longevity! Highlight what could be done in the future with more funding (dedicated server, team review)

Discuss data principiles such as FAIR, as directed by DFG 

Discuss incentives for data submission (maybe add to introduction aswell)

Give a short outline of what could be done with the database (broad, like in the grant proposal:
living meta-analyses, power simulations, etc.)
