# Introducing the Truth Effect Database (TED)
This repository contains the data and code for reproducing all results reported in our paper "Introducing the Truth Effect Database
(TED): An Open Trial-Level Resource Promoting FAIR Data in Truth Effect Research".

All data preparation and analysis is conducted in the scripts [`markdown/data_prep.Rmd`](markdown/data_prep.Rmd) and [`markdown/data_analysis.Rmd`](markdown/data_analysis.Rmd). All analysis are based on the version of TED at the time of submission (found here: [`markdown/data/ted.db`](markdown/data/ted.db).

The submitted manuscript deviates from the knit document only in format. To replicate the submission, begin by cloning this repository, installing the relevant packages and executing [`markdown/0_knit_document.R`](markdown/0_knit_document.R).
